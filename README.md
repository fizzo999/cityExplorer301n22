# Project Name City Explorer 301n22

**Author**: Fizzo Pannosch
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This is a Code Fellows 301 project to train students to make a server app. This App connects to the locationIQ API to convert a US city name into long and lat data that then is used for a secondary request. This second request is designed to hit the movie API, weather API and yelp API to get movie, weather and restaurant data for the city entered.

## Getting Started

git clone this repo to your local machine.
Create a .env file with the following tokens you will have to get from:
